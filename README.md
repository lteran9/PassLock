# PassLock

This project houses a password manager that encrypts and decrypts values provided by the user directly to the command line. It is an example of how to write clean code that communicates intention and avoids spaghetti code.

The [Program.cs](PassLock/Program.cs) file provides a high-level view of the operations supported by the password manager.
